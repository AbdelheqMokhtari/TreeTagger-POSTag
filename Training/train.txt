The	AT0

The	AT0

The	AT0

viral	AJ0

Her	PP$

The	AT0

The	AT0

His	PP$
statement	NN1
that	CST

no	AT0

The	AT0
belief	NN1
that	CST

The	AT0

that	CST

The	AT0
complaint	NN1
that	CST

triggered	VVD
a	AT0
rework	NN1

The	AT0
idea	NN1
that	CST

unrealistic	AJ0

The	AT0
understanding	NN1
that	CST

awkward	NN1

Her	PP$
conviction	NN1
that	CST

The	AT0
belief	NN1
that	CST

far-fetched	AJ0

The	AT0
dread	NN1
that	CST

their	PP$

His	PP$
claim	NN1
that	CST

the	AT0

The	AT0
choice	NN1
to	TO

a	AT0

one	NN1

The	AT0
belief	NN1

The	AT0

that	CST

the	AT0

Her	PP$

The	AT0
understanding	NN1

a	AT0
shock	NN1

The	AT0
recollection	NN1

The	AT0

The	AT0

The	AT0

that	CST

The	AT0

Her	PP$

The	AT0

His	PP$

The	AT0

Her	PP$

The	AT0

His	PP$

them	PP

The	AT0
notion	NN1
that	CST

The	AT0
understanding	NN1
that	CST

The	AT0

The	AT0

everyone	NN1

I	PP

the	AT0

The	AT0
expectation	NN1
that	CST

his	PP$

harsh	AJ0

The	AT0
vote	NN1

was	VVD
unanimous	AJ0

I	PP
dismissed	VVD
the	AT0

The	AT0

His	PP$

The	AT0
verdict	NN1
that	CST

upset	II
the	AT0

The	AT0
fear	NN1
that	CST

nervous	AJ0

I	PP
admired	VVD
her	PP

The	AT0
trust	NN1
that	CST

her	PP
peace	NN1

The	AT0
recommendation	NN1
that	CST

practical	AJ0

The	AT0
awareness	NN1
that	CST

came	VVD
too	RG0
late	AJ0

The	AT0
proof	NN1
that	CST

The	AT0
realization	NN1
that	CST

overwhelmed	VVD
him	PP

His	PP$

at	II
the	AT0
idea	NN1
that	CST

the	AT0
role	NN1

The	AT0
argument	NN1
that	CST

halted	VVD
progress	NN1

The	AT0
understanding	NN1
that	CST
we	PP

essential	AJ0

His	PP$
testimony	NN1
that	CST

nothing	NN1

unconvincing	VVG

I	PP
ignored	VVD
the	AT0

that	CST

The	AT0
assumption	NN1
that	CST

The	AT0

that	CST

a	AT0

I	PP

He	PP

I	PP

They	PP

I	PP
